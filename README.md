# roman_to_arabic
Convert roman numbers in to arabic numbers.

Type Roman Numerals in the textbox. Click the button "Convert" and it will display arabic number. First I pass roman value to the function roman_to_Int() which convert Roman number in to Integer value. roman_to_Int() returns integer value and then I pass it in to function numToArabicNumber(). Function numToArabicNumber() returns arabic numbers which I display in 2nd p with the help of bootstrap's class text-primary. I also check each character of input string and if it is in small letter I convert it in to capital letter and show it in first p.
